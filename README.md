# G1000 

This repository hosts the firmware and design files for the mrusk G1000 device. 

The implementation is based the original FlightSimMaker solution (see https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1siKPc6BkJSg9kihLLKLU8frNLp2IIBlw_dUE9n4Btq4).

Contains CAD files from the FlightSimMaker Discord https://discord.gg/YVbK6dmkeV.

3D Design also available at Printables: https://www.printables.com/de/model/199536-flight-simulator-g1000-nxi

PCBs to build the solution are currently out of stock. Order details are given in the building instructions. In case of trouble you may contact me via g1000nxi@outlook.de
